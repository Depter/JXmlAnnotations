The target of the project is to simplify the process of saving POJOs to xml and restoring them.

To reach this the classes and their members are annotated, to mark the structure of the resulting xml.

Instead of the aproach of JAXB, where the classes are generated from an xml-schema, here the xml
follows the structure of the java classes. For an example data structure see 
the package org.decsi.jaxml.testclasses int the Test Packages.

Currently the library can generate SAX events from the object structure, and reconstruct the
object structure from a SAX reader.
